"""A level's boxes, handed to the objects they reach -- its deferred decals, its reflection probes' boxes.

The source culls such boxes per pixel before shading (the decal pass projects each box into its GBuffer;
the probe binning marks the boxes that reach each froxel); a host shading each surface in one pass
walks them inside the material instead, and a material can only afford the boxes that can reach its
own object. Each object's list is the indices -- in the order the boxes are given, which is the order
the shading walks them -- of the boxes whose world bounds meet the object's world bounds: a
conservative cut, since the material tests every pixel against the box itself. Only objects with a
material that reads the per-object global get a list -- which materials read it is whatever their
graphs say (an object attribute node of that name, at any group depth).

Objects reaching the same boxes share one run: the distinct lists go end to end into one data table,
and each object carries where its run starts and how many entries it has as a per-object global (the
value minus the default the stacks declare, the encoding every per-object global uses). An object no
box reaches carries an empty run -- and, when that equals the declared default, nothing at all, so it
reads the default.
