"""What a stated light carries into the shading stacks beyond what the host's own light hands a light loop, stamped
once on the Blender light a statement made -- its content, like its colour.

Two things, both LIGHT attributes the stacks' one light template reads:

* the source's camera-distance fade, as four coefficients under :data:`material_builder.LIGHT_FADE_PROPERTY` -- every
  stack's template scales the light by it, the way the source's light list does for every one of its shaders;
* the source's own per-light parameter vectors (culling box, tube length, cookie rect, ...) for a stack that lights
  through the source's own light model, under the names that stack declares
  (:data:`material_builder.LIGHT_PARAMETERS`), in the order the statement states them.

A vector of zeros is not stamped: an attribute a light does not carry reads zero anyway (the stacks encode a plain
light as zeros), and every property on a light lengthens the search each of its attribute reads makes.
