"""The view a compositor tree solves its screen-space passes against, kept as one object the trees read.

A compositor tree runs for every frame it finishes -- each redraw of a 3D viewport as well as a final render -- yet it
has no node that reads the view it is finishing: its camera nodes name the scene camera. A screen-space pass
reconstructs positions from the depth it is handed, so solved against the scene camera it reconstructs them wrong in
every viewport not looked through that camera.

The viewpoint stands in the viewer's place: an empty linked into no scene, so nothing draws, selects or renders it,
while every tree that names it still evaluates it. It is the plugin's own data (:mod:`plugin_data`): never written to
a .blend, made again in each session that asks for it. Its object transform is the view's camera-to-world transform; the
view's projection is kept as a custom property on it, sixteen values row by row, which a tree reads through drivers.
A final render is drawn for the scene camera rather than for any viewport -- the trees tell the two apart with Is
Viewport. With an interface the viewpoint follows the 3D viewport the user last moved; without one it follows the
scene camera, so a background run evaluates what a render would see.

Only compositor trees read it. A geometry tree that named it would be evaluated again on every step of a viewport
orbit, and with it the deformation below it -- the whole vertex stage of every character on each redraw -- so the
vertex stage reads the scene camera instead. Every write re-evaluates each tree that reads the viewpoint, so a write
happens only when what it carries changed, and a file without a viewpoint costs the poll nothing: the object is found
once per file load or undo step, never by scanning on a tick.

A program that has to follow the view per vertex (an outline) is evaluated by the GPU in the material's
displacement, which already has the view matrix of every view it draws; what it lacks is the projection and the
size in pixels, stated on the objects that read them as the view window (:func:`sync_windows`). Those change with a
lens, a viewport size or a camera view, never with an orbit, so they cost the orbit nothing.
