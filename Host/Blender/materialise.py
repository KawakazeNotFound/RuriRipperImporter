"""Putting a stated selection into this document: rigs, objects, meshes,
materials, textures and morph targets.

THE ONE IMPORT PATH. There is no second one for a prefab, a scene window, an
assembled character, a level or a single mesh, because the kernel states all of
them the same way -- a transform tree, the meshes those transforms draw, the
skeletons they are skinned to, the materials they wear, the textures those read,
and the blend shapes they carry, every number already in this host's own basis.
What differs between a character and a level is how many rows come back.

Nothing here decides anything about the DATA: no hierarchy walk over engine
documents, no bind-pose baking, no coordinate conversion, no level-of-detail
rule, no material vocabulary, no per-game branch. Those all happened on the other
side over the buffers the decoder built. What is here is Blender: how a mesh
datablock is filled, how an armature's edit bones are laid out, how weights go in
through bmesh, how a shape key is added.
