"""Which generated shader stack this session is wiring, and where its files are.

The plugin used to carry the answer as a constant -- ``SHADER_NAME =
"Ruri_Endfield_Uber"`` and a ``shader/`` folder inside the package -- which made
the whole Painter half of the toolchain a one-game plugin by construction, and
put a game's name in a module that has no business knowing one.

The stack is instead resolved: the install publishes its own productName,
``Game/<that name>/shader/Substance/`` is where the generator was told to write
that game's Painter projection, and the shader's name is the name of the
manifest sitting in it. Adding a second game is a second recipe and a second
folder; nothing here changes, and nothing here spells a game.

WHICH install that is comes from the BROWSER, not from a stored copy of it. The
browser tab IS an install (its ``game_name`` is the productName that build
published), and the decoder, the texture-role layer and every game tab already
read it there. A second copy in the settings store drifted the moment the panel
that used to write it was deleted -- and drifted silently, as a stored empty
string that reads exactly like "not identified yet".
