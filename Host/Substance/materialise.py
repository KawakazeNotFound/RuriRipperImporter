"""Putting a stated selection into this application: one mesh file, and the
texture sets wired onto it.

Painter's entry point IS a file -- ``project.create`` takes a path and there is
no in-memory geometry API -- so materialising here writes one self-contained
glTF binary out of the statement, creates the project on it, splits every stated
texture into this application's engine channels, and wires the generated shader
onto each Texture Set.

That is not a lesser version of what the other host does; it is what this
application's project IS. A Texture Set is a material, so the geometry is
grouped by material rather than kept as a hierarchy, and a skinned mesh arrives
already baked to its rest -- which is the shape a painter wants anyway.

Nothing here decodes anything: the geometry is the statement's own arrays, and
every channel split is one named operation the kernel bakes.
