"""Browse the game's cast the way the game itself lists it -- in any host.

The rows come from the game's own config containers: playable characters keyed by
charId and grouped by the game's own profession, and npcs collapsed to one row per
distinct model prefab. Names are the real localized names, in whichever language
the HOST is running in -- its locale picks which text container the C# side joins
through, so switching the application's language switches the roster with no
reload of anything else.

The list behaves like the bundle browser next door: type to filter, click to
select, Load to bring it in. A row's payload is its seed, so Load and Reveal are the
kernel's own verbs and what a member IS is the hook's statement source.

The tab's SHAPE -- the pane switch, the facet, the search row, the list, the
shared buttons under it, the Anim and Face panes -- is the one every cast tab has
(``Kernel.app.cast_panel``). What is stated here is only what is this game's:
which sources its Anim and Face panes have besides the engine's own, and the one
option it adds under the list.

Nothing here imports a host. The Blender panel next door is a shell that
materialises this declaration; Painter's dock renders the same one.
