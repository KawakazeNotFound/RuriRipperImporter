"""Browse the game's places the way it lists them, and import one.

One list, because the game has one set of places under two names: every one is a
Unity level, and picking one and importing it is the whole interaction -- nothing
here is streamed, so there is no window to choose.

The list itself comes from the game's hook (the ``scene.places`` dataset) and the
filtering runs on the same C# engine the bundle browser uses, over that dataset's
own handle. A row's payload is its seed, so importing and revealing it are the
kernel's own verbs; nothing on this side reads a byte of the game, and nothing here
imports a host.
