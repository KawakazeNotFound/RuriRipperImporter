"""AzurPromilia -- everything the add-on has for this game and nothing else.

Three tabs, none of which means anything for another title:

``Scene``      every scene the install carries, under the folder tree the game files it in, saying
               which of them ship a built scene file at all. (``scene``)
``Character``  the cast off the game's own tables, one row per outfit under the character it
               dresses. (``roster``)
``Display``    the volume sets the render pipeline puts its post chain under, and the colour
               grading each gives it. (``display``)

Every reading behind them lives upstream in ``Ruri.RipperHook.AzurPromilia``: the configuration
tables and the cipher they are kept under, the outfit -> unit -> model join, and what an avatar seed
loads as -- the prefab plus the parts its own map wears, at one level. A row's payload is its seed,
so both tabs load and reveal through the kernel's own verbs.

Declared as one GAME_MODULE row (see ``Game``), so the core panel reveals both tabs exactly while
the install in front of it IS this game, and never names it itself.
