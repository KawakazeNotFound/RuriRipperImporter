"""Every scene the install carries, under the folder tree the game files it in.

A row says whether the BUILT scene file is present: this title rarely ships the built ``.unity``
with its packages, so most scenes arrive as terrain, materials and colliders only. A row without
one is dimmed rather than hidden -- its resources are real and loading them is a real act, it just
is not the scene itself.

A row's payload is its seed -- the built scene file, else the folder its resources are filed
under -- so Load and Reveal are the kernel's verbs over it, and this tab needs nothing of the host
the browser does not already need.

Nothing here imports a host.
