"""The one way anything reaches a document: seeds in, the host's own objects out.

A seed is the payload of a published row. What it IS -- which archives, which parts at which
level, which window of a level -- is answered once, on the reader side, by the statement source
of the game that published it; the reader's own resolution answers an archive, a container path
or a container folder of the loaded map. This asks for that answer in the host's basis and hands
it to the host. There is no second road: a panel's row, a browser selection, a stage's art and a
retarget's host rig all load by handing over seeds, and nothing here names a game or a host.
