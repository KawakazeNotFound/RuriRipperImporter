"""What a selection IS, read back as typed arrays.

The kernel answers every selection -- a cabmap row, a roster entry, a scene
window, an NPC recipe, an assembly plan, a level, a single mesh -- with ONE set
of tables, already in the basis the host asked for. This is the only module that
turns those bytes into arrays, and it is deliberately the only one: a second
place that knew a blob's stride would be a second place to keep in step with the
kernel that writes it.

Nothing here decides anything. There is no hierarchy walk, no skinning, no
coordinate conversion, no material vocabulary and no per-game branch -- those all
happened on the other side, where they are one implementation over the buffers
the decoder built rather than a python loop per asset. What a host does with the
answer is the host's; what the answer IS, is here.

A statement is asked for by SEED. A seed is the payload of any published row: an
archive or container path of the loaded map is the engine's own flattening, and
anything else is explained by the hook that published it. A panel therefore never
spells a seed -- it hands over the payload of the row the user picked.
