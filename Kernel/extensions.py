"""The one registry, for everything anything registers.

Before this there were fifteen pairs of ``register_x``/``unregister_x`` with a
module-level list behind each -- commands, panel sections, graph providers,
vertex stages, capability rewires, light-role refreshers, post stages, list
specs, mesh resolvers, detail rules. Every one of them had the same three
questions to answer and answered them slightly differently: what happens when
the same thing registers twice, what happens when a development reload
re-executes the module that declared it, and what happens when two different
modules claim one name.

So there is one answer here and no list anywhere else.

IDENTITY IS (declaring module, key). That is what tells a reload apart from a
collision: the same module declaring the same key again is the file on disk
having changed, and the new entry replaces the old one -- refusing it would
freeze the previous body in place while the source says otherwise.

A NAME is not the same thing as an identity, and only a name can collide. A
caller that STATES a key is claiming a name in the point's own namespace -- a
tab key, a command id, a section key -- and two modules claiming one of those is
two owners of one name, which is an error rather than a last-one-wins. A caller
that states none is identified by what it registered, and the qualified name of
a plain function is module-local by construction: two generated shading stacks
each own a ``refresh_main_light_role``, and they are two entries rather than one
collision. So the check runs on the stated key and on nothing else.
