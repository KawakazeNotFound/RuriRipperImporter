"""The port: everything the kernel asks of the application it is running inside.

One driver implements :class:`Host` and binds it. From then on the kernel talks
to that object and to nothing else application-shaped, which is what lets the
same import pipeline, the same material planning and the same browser serve
Blender and Substance Painter without either knowing the other exists.

WHAT A HOST CAN DO is the set of protocols its driver derives from, and nothing
else: a driver is a :class:`Host` and whichever of :class:`SceneGraph`,
:class:`Compositor`, :class:`Rig`, :class:`Timeline`, :class:`MorphTargets`,
:class:`NodeMaterials`, :class:`TextureCache`, :class:`TextureSets` and
:class:`DisplaySettings` it can actually answer. :attr:`Host.capabilities` reads
that back with ``isinstance``. There is no second list of capability names to
keep in step with the methods, and no method a host has to carry just to raise:
a host that cannot pose a skeleton is not a :class:`Rig`, and every option,
command, tab and section that names ``Rig`` is ABSENT there rather than broken.
No protocol is named after a host, and a kernel that branches on
``host.name == ...`` has quietly grown a per-host table of behaviour.
