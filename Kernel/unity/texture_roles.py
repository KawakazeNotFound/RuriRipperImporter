"""Which material property is which surface input -- as DATA, in layers.

A game's shaders name their properties however their authors typed them, so
"which texture is the base colour" is a mapping, and a mapping is configuration,
not code. This module holds the mechanism only: a role vocabulary, a table built
from JSON layers, a resolution of one material's property tables against it, and
the writer that records the choices a user makes. Which names mean what is stated
in the layer files:

* the DEFAULT layer beside this module (``TextureRoles.json``) -- Unity's own
  standard-shader vocabulary, plus the vocabulary the Ruri converters write when
  they have read a material's roles off its compiled shader (``_PackedMap`` and
  its channel floats, and the keyword that says the roles are proven);
* a GAME layer, kept in that game's own folder by the host that ships one;
* a USER layer, written by the host into its own workspace for a game that ships
  no folder, from the choices its user makes in front of the unmapped names.

Later layers override earlier ones property by property. A texture property no
layer names is UNMAPPED -- it is reported, never guessed at -- unless the material
carries the proven keyword, which says a converter already read every role off
the shader and what is left unnamed is unused.

Entry shapes, per texture property::

    {"role": "base_color"}                         a colour role: base_color, normal, emission
    {"role": "none"}                               known, and deliberately not wired
    {"channels": {"metallic": 0, "smoothness": 3}} scalar roles read from channel 0-3
    {"channels_from": {"metallic": "_PackedMapMetallic"}}
                                                   scalar roles whose channel a float
                                                   property of the material states
    {"role": "normal", "encoding": "hair_split"}   a decode the host knows by name

``colors`` and ``floats`` map a property name to the one role its value is.
