"""Asking the open session for a published dataset.

ONE session exists per process: the panel opens it on an install, loads that
install's map, and holds it (:mod:`Kernel.bridge.cabmap_state`). Everything that
wants a dataset -- a statement, a roster, a diagnostic -- asks through here, so a
statement always reads the map that is actually open rather than one of its own.

Nothing is parsed on this side: a table arrives columnar over pinned buffers and
a blob arrives as bytes.
